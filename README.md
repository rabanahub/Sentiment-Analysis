# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the process of classifying whether a block of text is positive, negative, or neutral.

**How Does Sentiment Analysis Work? **

Sentiment analysis in Python typically works by employing natural language processing(NLP) techniques to analyze and understand the sentiment expressed in text. The process involves several steps:

**Text Preprocessing**: The text cleaning process involves removing irrelevant information, such as special characters, punctuation, and stopwords, from the text data.
Tokenization: The text is divided into individual words or tokens to facilitate analysis.

**Feature Extraction**: The text extraction process involves extracting relevant features from the text, such as words, n-grams, or even parts of speech.
Sentiment Classification: Machine learning algorithms or pre-trained models are used to classify the sentiment of each text instance. Researchers achieve this through supervised learning, where they train models on labeled data, or through pre-trained models that have learned sentiment patterns from large datasets.

**Post-processing**: The sentiment analysis results may undergo additional processing, such as aggregating sentiment scores or applying threshold rules to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
Evaluation: Researchers assess the performance of the sentiment analysis model using evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.

**Types of Sentiment Analysis**
Various types of sentiment analysis can be performed, depending on the specific focus and objective of the analysis. Some common types include:

**Document-Level Sentiment Analysis**: This type of analysis determines the overall sentiment expressed in a document, such as a review or an article. It aims to classify the entire text as positive, negative, or neutral.

**Sentence-Level Sentiment Analysis**: Here, the sentiment of each sentence within a document is analyzed. This type provides a more granular understanding of the sentiment expressed in different text parts.

**Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**: This approach focuses on identifying and extracting the sentiment associated with specific aspects or entities mentioned in the text. For example, in a product review, the sentiment towards different features of the product (e.g., performance, design, usability) can be analyzed separately.

**Entity-Level Sentiment Analysis**: This type of analysis identifies the sentiment expressed towards specific entities or targets mentioned in the text, such as people, companies, or products. It helps understand the sentiment associated with different entities within the same document.

**Comparative Sentiment Analysis**: This approach involves comparing the sentiment between different entities or aspects mentioned in the text. It aims to identify the relative sentiment or preferences expressed towards various entities or features.
